## PayrollSys

> A distributed paying system based on blockchain for employees

## Instruction

In order to avoid the boss to arrears the wages of employees, we build a distributed paying system for those staffs. In the beginning a mouth, the boss needs to put the salary in a blockchain account. The employee can see this money. And at the end of this month, the employee can get this salary by call relevant functions. The system are deployed on our test blockchain.

## Innovation

One of our teammate's father has suffered a salary payment delay, and he happened to learn a lot about blockchain and smart contract. And we know that this is a trust problem and we believe that the blockchain 2.0 -- smart contract can help us solve this problem perfectly.

## Deploy

- set the pay duration

- the boss put the money in the account at the beginning of a mouth.

- the employee get the money at the end of this month

- you can add employee and change  their salary

## Technology

- Utilize truffle to deploy smart contract on the ropsten test network, which is run by infura on the block chain. It aims to ensure the trust of the back-end response.

- Utilize react-antd to design interactive user interface, which is beneficial for users to interact with smart chain.

- Code is packed that any user can make use of this code in local environment to make transaction with smart contraction under absolute trust principle.

## Future Work

In the future, we want to keep perfecting this system and try our best to solve the all potential problems between the boss and employee. If all thing goes well, we will issue our app in IOS and Andriod.
